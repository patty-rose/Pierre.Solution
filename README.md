navigate to your local host route /role. For example: https://localhost:5001/role
You should see that the Admin role has already been seeded into the app. You will need to click update and add a user to the Admin role. 

after declaring a user as an admin, if you were already logged in as that user, you need to be sure to log out and log in again as that user for the admin role to be applied.
